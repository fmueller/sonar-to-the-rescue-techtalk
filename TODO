- Introduction part

- Sonar part:
    * Overview, What is Sonar?
    * Usage in green field projects
    * Usage in legacy projects
        * Identify critical code (mostly untested code)
            * complex code, LCOM4 high...
    * Pimp my Sonar (just show or name some useful plugins, plugin roadshow)

- Demo part

ideas:
- know your tool: sonar run once a day is enough
- different dashboards for different roles
- use the widgets you need
- create action plans, either grouped by technical violations or by domain it tackles
- track metrics over time: software is not static, is continuously evolves
- define alerts that helps your team and ensures dicipline
- if it helps, use manuel metrics, e.g. for manual code reviews
- understand what is measured: http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Java+Metric+Definitions
- use the build breaker plugin to break the ci build if soner alert raises -> next morning devs are alerted and will fix the build

- take screenshots for example from nemo.sonarsource.org

- necessary plugins to be ready: scm activity plugin
- nice to have: weighted violations, taglist, security rules, build breaker
- for big button users: SIG Maintainability Model plugin, technical debt plugin, quality index plugin
- for worsest legacy projects ever: violation density plugin (http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Violation+Density+Plugin)

- use jacoco for code coverage: distinquish between integration test and unit test coverage (also good for legacy projects, testing happy paths first by integration and acceptance tests)
